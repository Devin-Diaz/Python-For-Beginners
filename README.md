My name is Devin Diaz, I'm a second year computer science student at Framingham State University. At my university, all the core major computer science courses are taught
in Java. However as I progress through my degree and opportunities arise, learning other languages with less boiler-plate code (no offense java) is a must. This repository, 
will have many exercises and examples that I have done in Java and converting them into python. Enjoy!
